**Team ID:** TH12065

---

## 1. Overview

DevoteeEase is an innovative web-based platform addressing the critical parking challenges during mass events like Simhastha Mahakumbh. It empowers local residents to list and rent out land as parking spaces to visiting devotees and tourists—enabling safer, smarter, and more efficient parking management. Visitors can easily locate, book, and pay for verified parking slots, while hosts benefit from new income opportunities and organizers achieve better congestion and safety control.

## 2. Problem & Solution

**Problem Statement**

 Simhastha Mahakumbh’s huge influx of pilgrims causes severe traffic jams, chaotic parking, pollution, and frequent accidents. Parking search is lengthy and stressful; underutilized local areas remain disconnected from visitor needs, making safe and available parking a major challenge.

**Solution**

 DevoteeEase connects locals with open land to visitors needing parking. Locals can register, set pricing, add images, and geo-map spaces. Visitors search for nearby slots, verify via map, pay online, and receive confirmation/invoice. Real-time slot updates and monitoring ensure robust parking control and maximum safety.

## 3. Logic & Workflow

### Data Collection

- Hosts register/KYC, enter location, images, pricing, slot count (map picker).
- Visitors input ride details, filter options, select dates for parking.

### Processing

- System confirms availability by date/count.
- Dynamic pricing based on demand/location.
- Online payments via secure gateways.
- Automated email notification and invoice after booking.

### Output

- Hosts view dashboards with slots, images, bookings, and alerts.
- Visitors receive booking confirmations, invoices, and manage reservations.
- Admins monitor parking activity and send safety notifications (planned for future development).

### User Side

- Register/login, search slots, book/pay online, receive invoice.
- View active/past bookings, use filters and payment history.

### Admin Side

- Host approval via KYC.
- Monitor slots, bookings, heatmaps (zone congestion, red alerts).
- Manage reviews, complaints, host verification badges.
- *(Architected for future enhancements)*
